# Slinky.gg cracked

# All credits go to PlutoSolutions!
The original crack: https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/Slinky
##
Decided to make an open-source version of the Slinky.gg crack injector. The original injector was closed source, so this version was created as an alternative.

## Disclaimer

Slinky.gg has been known to issue copyright strikes on YouTube videos that mention the crack. Please be aware of this if you plan to create content around this software.

## Build

To build the injector just use g++:

```bash
g++ injector.cpp -o injector
```
Or use the already built version from the releases. (if you dont want to build it)
